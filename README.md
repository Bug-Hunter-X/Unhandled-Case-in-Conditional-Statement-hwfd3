# Julia Bug Report: Unhandled Case in Conditional Statement

This repository demonstrates a common error in Julia: failing to handle all possible cases in a conditional statement. The function `my_function` correctly squares positive and negative numbers but doesn't explicitly handle the case where the input is zero. This omission can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.  The solution provides a corrected version of the function.
